小安阅读学习法（中英文对照）
 
新手上路，对深海微风，windjoy的资料重新整理了一下，（因为有一段话和windjoy理解好像不一样，黑体字注明），贴出来看看，希望NN指正。        先谢谢了。
 
There is a good way to improve reading, try to get my post and try to practice hard on the second round review, you can get a framework of RC and you will hardly do wrong on some question types, and then again the third round review will help you to practice what you learned from the second round, do not ignore this round, because when I finally take test, I have no tip for any question types. The tips I summarized are all translated into a feeling, I can easily correctly choose the answer according to my feelings, you have to practice to get those tips all translated into a habit. 
有一种提高阅读能力的好办法，尝试得到我的帖子，         并在第二轮复习中练习，你可以得到RC的框架，这样你在一些题型上就不大会出错。接着，第三轮复习将帮助你练习你在第二轮复习中学到的东西，不要忽视这一轮学习。因为当我最终参加考试时，对各种题型的考试技巧我没有什么技巧，我总结的技巧都已经被转化为自己做题的感觉了，也就无技巧可言了。我能够根据自己的感觉轻易选出正确答案。记住：你必须不断练习来得到那些技巧并把他们都转化为自己做题的习惯。
Before you practice, try to think "why those answers are wrong?", "Is there anything common in the wrong answers?", "And in the right answers?" Try to comprehend what is "related" and what is "unrelated"，do not easily judge, try to comprehend what is "related" and what is "unrelated"?? What is "related" and what is "unrelated" information (choice), that is a very important rule to quickly rule out some wrong choices and the next is "what is conform to the author", "what is conform to the author's attitude", and "what is not (also choices)".
在你练习前，尝试去思考那些选项为什么不正确。错误的选项之间是否有共性的东西。同样正确选项之间是否也有？尝试理解什么是相关的选项，什么是无关选项。判断是否相关要看：是否和作者的态度相符。绝不要轻易做判断！这是把错误选项迅速排除的一条非常重要的规则。
If you see, try to read the passage again for the attitude info, this is a great rule to rule out some wrong choices, the attitude thing and I can tell you that, I did all the RC infer question without relocate because I can easily rule out wrong answers, memorize the pattern, and try to practice. Without practice, you can get nothing. But it is the goal; you should do something before hand. First, categorize all the RC questions You should guarantee 100% right on "main idea" type questions, try to collect all detail questions, I mean those with line number or key words, try to get these right answer back to the passage. You will see some question rules. I do not want to tell you because you can get the rules by yourself, if I tell you the detailed rule, you will not certainly get what I mean.
如果你明白了，下一步就是：尝试重新读一下段落来得到关于作者的态度的信息。作者的态度也是迅速排除错误选项的一个重要法则，知道它，我做推断的题目可以根本不用重新查找出处，因为我能够很容易地排除错误选项。记住这个模式，并试着练习。没有练习，你什么都得不到！不过，这是一个目标，你应该先做一些预备工作。首先，把所有RC的问题分类。你必须确保“主旨”类题100％正确。接着，努力收集所有关于细节的问题，即那些有行号或中心词的问题。尝试把正确答案放回原来段落，你就可以发现一些出题的规律。我并不想告诉你那些规律是什么，因为你可以自己找出他们。如果我告诉你那些详细的规律，你就不会真正完全理解我所表达的意思。而且不同的人见解都不同。
Then collect the "structure type", and promise yourself you can do 90% right or higher, it is just easy like "main idea and attitude" thing. Do you know why you should get question types apart? First, you can get suttle feelings about how to make a question Second, you can get info about how to prepare to do those questions when you are reading the passage, it is very important to get the question right, you will see when you finished summarizing, you can easily tell that "oh, I think ETS will make a question in here", when you are reading the passage, when you know there is a structure type questions, you will think following questions when reading: 1. why the author write this paragraph? 2. What he want to tell us? 3. Is there any change in attitude? 4. What is the function of the detail in this paragraph? 5. What may be the relation between this paragraph and the whole passage? That is very important! Not everyone do that when reading, so they have to relocate info and it cost precious time, you should analyze the question like "what can I get the answer when I read", it is equal to "what part of passage I should read carefully when I read", I get all passages reread and underlined what part is the key to question. I mean on the passage using fluerecent pen, it is very clear.
 
接下来收集结构型问题。然后对自己承诺你要有能力做到90％正确或更高，这就像“主旨”或“态度”题一样简单。而需要把这些问题归类的原因是：首先，这样你对如何出题能有真实的感觉。其次，你在阅读段落时就能得到关于如何准备做那些问题的信息，这对正确回答问题很重要。你会发现，当你完成归纳时，你在阅读时就能很容易就指出：嘿，我觉得ets会在这里出题。当你知道这里可能会出一个结构类问题时，你阅读时你就会思考以下问题。
1。作者为什么写这段话。2。作者想告诉我们什么东西3。作者的态度是否有变化4。这段话提出的细节有什么作用5。这段话和整个段落的联系是什么。以上几点非常重要，并不是所有人做阅读时都这样做，所以他们必须回读原文的信息。而这，浪费了宝贵的做题时间。你必须分析这些问题，比如：哪一段是我应该仔细阅读的？我所有段落都会重读一下，并用荧光笔在问题下画线，指出哪里是解答问题的答案。这，只是第一步。
 
Second: try to get all infer question collected, try to contrast the answer and the original text and try to get what is wrong about the wrong questions。Why they are all wrong, do not stop on why they are all wrong when you can get some feeling like "too extreme", you should think hard on how to quickly rule out some of them, that is the "related/unrelated" stuff. And the "attitude" stuff, which I mentioned above, the infer questions are very important if you want to get higher scores such as 730+. You should categorize on subject matter, you will see that what the "science" passages want to test you on. The most important is "the whole logic relation between facts and stuffs", you have to get the logic relation between A,B,C,D...A lead to B, C can restrain A. D can restrain B, you must quickly realized that both C and D can restrain B, only A can lead to B, you only should memorize the "either lead to or restrain" relationships between things, do not get it more complicated, you will confused if you do not memorize or memorize too much. So just lead to or restrain, just support or do not support, that is enough for quickly ruling out most confusing wrong answers without relocating.When you get 文科 passages, pay more attention on 列举, when you get economic and management passages, pay more attention to the logic推理顺序and support/unsupported relationship. You can easily get the feeling if you summarize and can get detailed feelings.
第二步：试着找到所有的推断题，尝试对比答案和原文。并且尝试找到错误答案到底错在哪里！当你做题时得到一些感觉，比如“选项看法过于极端”等，不要停止思考，而应该继续考虑为什么他们都是错的。这是一个“有关”还是“无关”的问题，还有我以上提到的“态度”的问题。如果你想得到高分（比如730以上）的话，推断问题就会非常重要。你应该归类所有题目，这样你能够发现科技文章到底想测试你一些什么问题。最重要一点是要找出事实和材料之间的整个逻辑关系。你必须得到abced之间的逻辑关系……。比如，a导致b，c可以限制a，d可以限制b。你必须很快意识到c和d都能够抑制b，而只有a能导致b。你只应记住事物之间“非导致即抑制”的关系而不要弄得太复杂。如果你不去记忆或者你记忆太多，你就会被搞糊涂。所以记住：“非导致即抑制”，如果难以掌握，就记“非支持即不支持”。以上应该足够很快排除最混淆的错误答案而不用重新回读。
当你看文科段落时，需更注意列举，但当你看经济或管理段落时，需更注意逻辑推理顺序以及支持/非支持关系。只要你总结并能得到详细的感受，你能很容易得到做题的感觉。这点非常重要。以上做完，第二轮就结束了。
Third:
1. Try to directly get all the answers from passage because you are familiar with the passages. Do not see the questions, try to get what may be a question here
2. When you finished reading, try to write the frame in Chinese (or English) in a paper. It is quite like to write down 机经, do not read questions, do not read the passage when you write the frame,
Why you have to do this?
--To know what you have forgotten and the capacity of your memorization and you can improve in the next passage. Every paragraph, five questions and what may be the key point for questions and finally you will improve on the ability to memorize more of the passage framework, the more and the clear you can memorize the frame of the passage, the less time you have to spend on questions, practice in this round and try to get all your tips summarized into reading, you cannot tell clear rules finally, and you have get the all steps. On the third round, try to answer the questions after finish the writing. Why? It is for structure question. Try to practice "related/unrelated" and "conform or not conform to the attitude" rule, this is all I know about RC review and try to practice more passages in one day on the second round. The more you can get in one day, the stronger you feel about RC, it's easy to say but very tough.
 
还有第三轮，请尝试直接从段落中找到答案，因为通过前面复习，你对段落已经很熟悉了。不要看问题，试着直接找到“这里可能会出问题”的地方。当你结束阅读后，尝试在纸上用英语或中文写出文章的架构，这，很像写机经。你写框架时注意不要读段落。你必须这样做，因为你这是为了解答结构性问题。通过写框架，你可以知道你已经忘掉的东西和你记忆的容量，这样你就能在下一个段落中改善。每一段中，记下5个问题和那些可能是问题的关键点，你最终能发现你的能力提高了，你能够记住比以前更多的段落大意。你能记住的段落大意越多越清楚，你花在回答问题上的时间就越少。在这一轮中练习并尝试得到你的技巧并将其归纳入阅读，当你最终自己不再能分辨出一条条清楚的规律时，你就完成了所有步骤。
在第三轮中，写下后再尝试回答这些问题，因为这样可以练习一下“相关/无关”及“符合/不符合作者态度”的规则。以上是我所知关于RC复习的所有经验。在第二轮复习中，你需要尝试在一天里练习越来越多的段落。你每天能练的越多，你做RC题目的感觉就越强烈。当然，说着容易做着难。
