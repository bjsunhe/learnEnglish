MOOCs Won’t Replace Business Schools — They’ll Diversify Them

Over the past few years, business school administrators — like other university officials — have been losing sleep over Massive Open Online Courses (or MOOCs), worrying that these low-cost digital alternatives will cannibalize their business model.

As elite business schools have started to offer their own courses through platforms like Coursera, commentators have pointed out that it’s now possible to cobble together an elite MBA for free. Others have argued that executive education programs are likely to be disrupted, as companies weigh the savings they could achieve by directing executives to MOOCs instead. These programs are a crucial source of revenue for business schools. At Wharton, nearly 20% of the annual revenue comes from executive education, while at Harvard Business School 26% does, and at IESE, it is nearly half.

Are these fears well founded? The answer depends on the students participating in MOOCs. If they fit the profile of traditional MBA or executive education enrollees, then the threat to business schools is clear. Our data suggest that this is not the case. At least at present, MOOCs run by elite business schools do not appear to threaten existing programs, but seem to attract students for whom traditional business school offerings are out of reach.

Though a few studies from Harvard, MIT, and the University of Pennsylvania have examined MOOC participants, none to date have focused specifically on those taking business classes. We analyzed data on over 875,000 students enrolled in nine MOOCs offered by the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. This includes a demographic survey with over 65,000 responses. The nine courses consisted of four that introduce the MBA core — Accounting, Finance, Marketing, and Operations Management — as well as Gamification and the Global Business of Sports. These business MOOCs do not appear to be cannibalizing existing programs but do seem to be reaching at least three new and highly sought-after student populations.

According to the Wharton data, 78% of individuals who registered for an online business course came from outside of the United States. For comparison, Executive MBA programs in 2012 only attracted an average of 14% foreign students. Part-time or flexible MBA programs attracted 10%-32% foreign students, depending on the type of program. Even full-time two-year MBA programs, which attracted 45% foreign students, fall far short of the international reach of these business MOOCs.

It is clear that none of the traditional business education programs can match the global reach of MOOCs, which is all the more impressive when you consider that they are operating at significantly larger scale.

For business schools, then, MOOCs are a tremendous opportunity to expand into underserved markets. Nearly half of the international students enrolled in Wharton’s MOOCs hail from developing countries.

Businessmen and women in developing countries have few sources for high quality management training; there are only five business schools in all of sub-Saharan Africa that have received AACSB, AMBA, or EQUIS accreditation –  all in South Africa. They are turning to MOOCs for accessible world-class training.

Even among U.S. enrollees, there appear to be important differences between the population of MOOC students and traditional business school students. First, well-educated foreign-born U.S. residents appear to be overrepresented in business MOOCs. Overall, 35% of all U.S. individuals enrolled in the Wharton business MOOCs are foreign-born, with 54% having a graduate or professional degree. Only 12.9% of the U.S. population is foreign-born. Though MOOC enrollees are quite educated overall, the rate of advanced degrees for foreign-born U.S. enrollees exceeds that of other students.

17%, or one in six, of the highly educated, foreign-born American enrollees in business MOOCs are unemployed, higher than the 13% unemployment rate for native-born American MOOC enrollees. Again, we seem to be seeing groups of individuals who cannot access elite executive education courses obtaining training through MOOCs. And for the unemployed, this may be a way to obtain credentials and skills to enhance job searches.

The final group enrolling in business MOOCs is underrepresented minorities. In open, online Wharton business courses, 19% of American students are underrepresented minorities, compared to 11% of students enrolled in traditional MBA programs at nine of the top U.S. business schools. And in terms of absolute numbers, not just percentages, there are vastly more underrepresented minorities online. Across those nine top business schools, that 11% represents just 315 underrepresented minority MBA students, while 19% of the Wharton online business classes constitute 166,552 underrepresented minority students.

Business schools are trying to attract these three groups — students from outside the United States, especially developing countries, foreign-born Americans, and under-represented American minorities. According to the 2012 Application Trends Survey by the Graduate Management Admission Council, these populations were among the most likely to receive special, targeted outreach by business schools. Open, online business courses are reaching them in droves. These MOOC courses might then provide a highly enriched recruiting pool for full-time and executive MBA courses.

One area where business MOOCs are falling short is in attracting female students. While more than 40% of applicants to MBA programs are now women, only 32% of students enrolled in business MOOCs are women. That number drops to 23% in BRICS countries. Women in the developing world face even greater barriers to traditional business training than their male counterparts. Careful marketing aimed at these women might open the door for yet another large population of new business school students.

If business schools want to take advantage of the MOOC opportunity to reach a more diverse group of students, they should seek to better understand those students’ motivations. For instance, lots of previous debate over MOOCs has focused on the relatively low rate of course completion. Indeed, only one out of every twelve students who enrolled in Wharton’s courses were still watching the lectures after eight weeks. Only 5% completed all of the course material and assessments (slightly higher than the 3% rate for non-business courses). And it turns out these “completers” tend to be disproportionately male, well educated, employed, and from OECD countries. Among American students, they tend to be white.

On its face, this finding might seem to undermine MOOCs’ potential to enhance the diversity of business school offerings. But for many students, completing an online course is not the most important outcome. Just 43% of respondents to a pre-course survey administered to nine business and non-business courses at Penn indicated that receiving a certificate of accomplishment was “extremely important” or “very important” to them. Similarly, edX has found that only 27% rank earning a certificate of mastery as extremely important.

Business schools must bear this in mind and move away from a business model of charging for certificates of completion. Instead, they must tailor offerings to the goals of these learners, whatever they may be. This could be as simple as moving to a monthly subscription or “freemium” model for access, or it could mean a more fundamental rethinking of what comprises a “course” online.

It is clear from our research that, rather than cannibalizing business school course offerings and executive education, open, online business courses appear for now to be expanding the overall reach of business education. Even in their infancy, business MOOCs from Wharton are reaching groups of students most commonly targeted for outreach by business schools: working professionals outside the United States as well as foreign-born and underrepresented minorities in the United States.

MOOCs are undoubtedly disrupting higher education. Business schools, like other university institutions, will need to strategically adapt to changing circumstances. But the MOOC disruption may not necessarily be the threat everyone is worried about. In fact, it looks more like an opportunity.




3 Ways Data Dashboards Can Mislead You

Executives love dashboards, and why wouldn’t they? Single-screen “snapshots” of operational processes, marketing metrics, and key performance indicators (KPIs) can be visually elegant and intuitive. They show just-in-time views of what’s working and what isn’t — no need to wait for weekly or monthly reports from a centralized data center. A quick scan of a dashboard gives frontline managers transparency and, ideally, the opportunity to make rapid adjustments.

But dashboards aren’t the magic view some managers treat them as. Although they can convey snapshots of important measures, dashboards are poor at providing the nuance and context that effective data-driven decision making demands.

Data analytics typically does a few things:

describes existing or past phenomena
predicts future events based on past data
prescribes a course of action
Most dashboards, though, only cover the first — describing what has happened. Moving from description to prediction to action requires knowledge of how the underlying data was generated, a deep understanding of the business context, and exceptional critical thinking skills on the part of the user to understand what the data does (and doesn’t) mean. Dashboards don’t provide any of this. Worse, the allure of the dashboard, that feeling that all the answers are there in real time, can be harmful. The simplicity and elegance can tempt managers to forget about the all-important nuances of data-driven decision making.

To get better at creating and using dashboards, think about these three drawbacks to data dashboards.

The Importance Trap
Every dashboard is built on a set of priorities and assumptions about what’s important. Many times those priorities are defined by IT, a design expert, or a consultant who deploys dashboards and doesn’t know the company that well. Sometimes, the priorities may even be the default measurements provided by the dashboard software.

In many of these cases, companies end up with official-looking views into data that doesn’t align with business priorities.

For instance, a small-business owner may have a dashboard that shows a moving average of his customers’ inter-purchase times. Is this information worthy of “front-page attention” each day? Probably not. Not only does the metric itself require significantly more information to drive action, but it simply doesn’t align with his goals and business model.

It should go without saying that all elements of a dashboard should be relevant and important. If the choice of what information to present in a dashboard is made without the input of those closest to the business context — whether through default software settings or what one person building the dashboard happens to think is important — it is highly unlikely that the dashboard will be maximally useful.

The Context Trap
Too often, we think of analytics as representing some sort of unbiased and dispassionate truth. We equate “empirical” and “quantitative” with “objective.” This dangerous belief leads managers to track and even act on metrics simply because they appear on a dashboard — and, well, dashboards don’t lie, right?

Consider the manager tasked with maximizing sales leads. He helped design a simple view on his dashboard to see how leads are coming in to the company over time. He sees an upward sloping cyclical pattern:


W170109_SHAPIRO_NUMBEROF


Based on this data, the manager might focus on the period when leads coming in were highest — here, the second-to-last peak — and try to understand the conditions present during that peak period.

However, one could reasonably argue that the period of greatest “success” in this graphic is actually the point at which the number of leads most exceeds the expected number of leads, given the history of cyclicality and growth. If we overlay a deviation from expected leads curve, a different picture emerges:

W170109_SHAPIRO_ACTUALEXPECTED


In this example, the most notable time period may be where expected leads peak (where the gray line is at its highest) but actual leads are low. A manager who seeks to understand the conditions for lead generation success may want to focus energy there rather than when leads were, and were expected to be, high.

As this example hints at, there are myriad ways to present data. The burden is on the interpreter and user of the dashboard to ensure that the most relevant and useful metric is conveyed.

The Causality Trap
Perhaps the greatest danger in using dashboards for decision making is in misattributing causality when comparing elements on the dashboard.

Comparisons are a dashboard’s bread and butter, such as showing sales by region, financial performance by month, customer inquiries by channel, and so forth.

It’s far too easy — and unfortunately common — for managers to interpret the groupings in a dashboard as causative when they may not be.

What if you saw a dashboard graphic like the one below, showing a comparison of lung cancer rates between people who carry lighters or matches in their pockets and those who don’t?

W170109_SHAPIRO_LUNGCANCER



Would you conclude from this comparison that carrying lighters and matches causes lung cancer? Probably not. You would instead surmise that people who carry lighters and matches are more likely to smoke, and that smoking causes cancer.

In their specific business context, however, managers frequently fall into the trap of concluding that lighters and matches cause cancer. Dashboards lead them to assign causality when they shouldn’t.

Consider a large package delivery company that wanted to reduce vehicle accidents. To do so, they offered drivers the option to upgrade their GPS to a system that would help them avoid high-risk traffic areas. After monitoring drivers’ behaviors for a week, a frontline manager checked her dashboard and found, to her surprise, that the accident rate was actually higher with the upgrade than without:

W170109_SHAPIRO_ACCIDENTRATE1


Many managers would look at this graphic and assign causality. Drivers who upgraded their GPS were in more accidents, therefore the GPS upgrade backfired miserably.

But the upgrade was actually quite effective. The manager would have seen this by comparing accident rates for drivers that the company categorizes as “accident prone” or “safe”:

W170109_SHAPIRO_ACCIDENTRATE2


For both groups, the upgrade made them safer. So why did the accident rate increase for the entire fleet of drivers while decreasing for each group? Because in this case almost all of the accident-prone drivers chose to use the upgraded device and almost all of the safe drivers kept the old device. Preexisting driver behavior was confused with the effectiveness of the upgrade.

Before dashboards, answering the question of whether the upgrade was effective would have required a data-savvy individual, probably someone trained in statistics. This person almost certainly would have asked, “What else, other than the upgrade, might be responsible for the increase in accidents?” The manager’s mistake would have been avoided easily.

But when managers rely only on data dashboards, with the hope and expectation that these visual tools will facilitate decision making, serious shortcomings emerge. Without the nuance and context that dashboards don’t reveal, managers can come to some very wrong conclusions.





How to Turn an Interim Role into a Permanent Job

Congratulations! Your organization has just informed you that you have been appointed to a new interim role, and that if you are successful the actual job will be yours. You immediately experience feelings that are powerful but mixed: Getting this interim role is a meaningful validation of your contributions, talent, and potential, but why the trial period? Couldn’t they have given you the job without it being “interim?” Is the actual job yours to win or yours to lose? Will you get the support you need to succeed?

You may think that the interim role is putting you in a Catch-22-like situation: You have to prove that you can be successful in order to get the actual job, but uncertainty undermines your status and challenges your ability to succeed. Here are some suggestions for increasing the likelihood of your success in an interim role:

Ask “Why?” Knowing why you have been chosen for an interim role will help you formulate a strategy for keeping the job long term. It may be that your predecessor is ambivalent about succession or has not set a clear timetable for retirement. Or there may be systemic bias in your organization — your age, experience, gender, or race may cause the “old boys’ club” in senior management to believe that you need training wheels before you can take on a senior-level job. Perhaps, for whatever reason, you do not have a broad enough internal network or deep enough support for your candidacy. Or maybe you have an innovative, disruptive vision that others are simply not ready for or are resistant to.

To gain a better understanding of how organizational factors and your personal attributes may influence your current situation, ask trusted colleagues, coaches, mentors, or sponsors for their views on why you specifically have been offered the interim role.

Have patience. While you don’t want to signal that you will be comfortable serving in an interim capacity indefinitely, it’s important not to push too hard or too fast for closure. At a certain point you may be tempted to force the organization’s hand, either by threatening to quit or by letting your boss, senior management, or HR know that you plan to begin searching for a different role inside the company or elsewhere. However, doing so can damage important relationships.

When you convey to others in the organization that you will quit if you don’t get the job soon, you are both lowering their assessment of the probability of future interaction with you and diminishing their perceived incentive to collaborate with you, both of which are key predictors of people being “prosocial” and collaborative. Although you may hope that your path to promotion will be a sprint, it may feel more like a marathon.

Focus on learning. Approach the interim role as a joint problem-solving exercise, one involving you, your boss, and others in the organization. If the organization offers you a leadership development program, a management course, or an opportunity to have a mentor or to work with an executive coach, think of it as a chance to enhance your skills, rather than a remedial exercise, and accept the invitation.

By taking a learning approach, being open to feedback, and demonstrating commitment to professional development and continuous improvement as a leader and manager, you can empower your supporters in the organization to more effectively advocate for your candidacy.

Align your authority and accountability. The inherent ambiguity in an interim role makes it likely that there will be gaps between your actual and perceived positional power and what you are expecting to accomplish or achieve. To overcome this lack of clarity, you can ask your boss or others in senior management or HR about their views of your accountability. Try to create clear alignment between your authority and that accountability. For example, if you are supervising others in the interim role and are accountable for their performance, it is essential that you have the authority to evaluate their performance. If your predecessor remains in their job while you are in the interim role, it is important to clearly delineate your respective accountabilities and levels of involvement, for example which meetings they will attend, which meetings you will attend, and which meetings you will attend together. Balance is important — you want to convey respect for your predecessor and include them when appropriate but not be so deferential that you are perceived as being unready to step up to the next level.

Managing the emotions and politics of an interim role while also doing the job can be difficult. Understanding your situational challenges and opportunities, remaining flexible and positive, and aligning your accountability with your authority can increase the odds that your interim role will take you where you want to go.





What Matters More to Your Workforce than Money


Economists have long argued that money doesn’t buy happiness. But compensation is still a major factor for us when we’re considering where to work. What do we know about how more pay influences employees’ motivations?

That slice of information can be the difference between a workforce that is satisfied and productive and one that isn’t — costing the business money in the long run.

As the chief economist at Glassdoor, my role is to help unearth some of the driving forces behind job seekers’ decisions: why they choose the jobs they do, what matters to them at work, and what causes them to love — or despise — their company or manager.

Money Can’t Buy Happiness
At Glassdoor we have a unique window into the labor market, as we use reviews and salary surveys to gather insights about companies and employee sentiment. The result is a wealth of real-world data, allowing us to identify the factors beyond pay that really drive happiness at work.

One of the most striking results we’ve found is that, across all income levels, the top predictor of workplace satisfaction is not pay: It is the culture and values of the organization, followed closely by the quality of senior leadership and the career opportunities at the company. Among the six workplace factors we examined, compensation and benefits were consistently rated among the least important factors of workplace happiness.

The fact that pay is not the main driver of worker satisfaction will come as little surprise to economists. Writing more than 250 years ago, in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Adam Smith famously warned that material gains often make us less happy, not more. A 2010 study from Princeton University researchers showed that having a higher income increases happiness but only up to about $75,000 per year. Beyond that, higher pay doesn’t influence happiness much, and other factors take over.

Our Glassdoor analysis echoes these findings in the workplace. Data scientist Patrick Wong and I took a sample of more than 615,000 Glassdoor users who had both reported their pay and written a review of their employer since 2014. We placed them into four salary groups, from lowest (those earning under $40,000 a year) to highest (those earning over $120,000), and looked at the relative explanatory power of each for employee satisfaction. If we think of our model as a pie of explanatory power, each workplace characteristic represents a slice. Factors with the biggest slices are the biggest drivers of workplace happiness. This data is correlational, but in conjunction with similar results from other research, we believe it offers some recommendations for managers nonetheless.

Higher-Earning Employees Have Different Priorities
Although money isn’t a major driver of employee satisfaction, a person’s workplace priorities do change as their income rises. For example, the culture and values of the organization explain about 21.6% of worker satisfaction in the lowest income group, but that rises to 23.4% for the highest incomes. This suggests that higher earners want their employers to share their values and create a positive company image.

Other factors whose importance rises as compensation does include the quality of senior leadership (which rises from 20.4% to 22.8% of the predictive pie as income rises) and the importance of career opportunities (rising from 17.5% to 22.8%). At higher pay levels, workers clearly place more emphasis on culture and long-term concerns like leadership and growth opportunities, rather than day-to-day concerns like pay and work-life balance.

By contrast, three of the factors we examined were less important to higher-earning employees. Work-life balance declines in importance at higher income levels, falling from 13.2% of the predictive pie to 9.5% as pay rises. High earners are more willing to give up leisure time for work income. We were interested to find that the employer’s business outlook also declines in importance as income rises, but the shift is small.

Finally we found that compensation and benefits, in addition to being among the least important factors, fall in importance as income rises. For those earning less than $40,000 annually, pay accounts for only 12.8% of workplace satisfaction. As salary rises, the predictive power of compensation and benefits falls sharply, dropping to 9.8% of the pie for those earning more than $120,000 annually.

Focus on Culture Without Compromising Pay
Although pay is not the most important driver of employee satisfaction, these results don’t suggest that employers can disregard it. Compensation and benefits may have less predictive power for employee satisfaction than the other factors, but it is still the top factor that job seekers consider when evaluating potential employers, according to a recent Glassdoor survey — particularly for job seekers weighing competing offers. For the purpose of attracting talent, offering competitive pay and benefits remains critical for employers.

However, once employers have begun offering pay that’s within the range of competing firms, what’s the next step for improving employee morale, engagement, and productivity? Our research suggests that further tinkering with the compensation package is not likely to improve employee satisfaction much, particularly among higher-earning employees.

While pay can help get new talent in the door, our research shows it’s not likely to keep them there without real investments in workplace culture: making a commitment to positive culture and values, improving the quality of senior management, and creating career pathways that elevate workers through a career arc in the organization.








How Managers Can Make Group Projects More Efficient

We may have hit a saturation point when it comes to collaboration. Consider the following:

Research out of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and the University of Virginia’s McIntire School of Commerce shows that time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50% or more over the last two decades.
A recent article in The Economist called this trend the “collaboration curse,” asserting that “making employees collaborate has gone too far.”
Research has found that although some teams have a collaborative culture, they are not skilled in the practice of collaboration itself. The authors of that research, Lynda Gratton and Tamara Erickson, noted that “[people] were encouraged to cooperate, and they wanted to cooperate, but they didn’t know how to work together very well.”
As a manager or team leader, how do you reap the benefits of effective collaboration without inviting inefficiencies and messiness?

Don’t engage in collaboration for the sake of collaboration. Remember the reasons why we collaborate. No one person has the best ideas. Putting many heads onto a complex problem is often the best way to come up with a solution. Many hands can make light work.

Respect others’ time and show up prepared. It can be tempting to want to include everyone on a project, but if you’re the lead of a team or meeting, you need to be thoughtful about who is in the room. Bring together the people who are closest to the problem — those who understand the issue at the root level. Be clear about who is coming and why, and spend time preparing how you’re going to tackle a problem.

In some situations, it may make sense to stay open-ended and brainstorm with team members by saying:

What do you think? What’s your perspective?
I’m not looking for an answer right now and I don’t have one yet. I wanted to get this on your radar and give you some time to think about this.
In other cases, we can save people’s time and provide leadership by sharing our views and asking others to weigh in:

I value your input. Here’s what I’m thinking. What am I not taking into consideration or factoring in?
Here’s a potential direction and how we could get there. What resonates and what doesn’t?


Listen, be open to change, or respectfully disagree. Reaping the value of others’ thinking requires that we listen and make it safe for people to share their views. In the New York Times Magazine article “What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team,” researchers found that high-performance teams typically had environments of “psychological safety…a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up…a climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.”


Listening is a key part of the collaborative process. However, collaborative listening does not mean agreeing blindly. Instead, use what you heard to broaden your possible responses by:

Seeking more information: “I wasn’t aware of that piece of information. I’d like to dig into that a bit more.”
Shifting your original view: “Last week what I believed based on the data was X. With this new perspective and information, I am thinking about this quite differently. My view has changed.”
Communicating disagreement with respect: “I have always valued your judgment. In digesting what you shared, I am finding I just can’t get comfortable with that direction. Ultimately, this is coming down to a difference of opinion.”
Acknowledge decision making and other potential ownership rights. While it’s important that you hear out and value others’ perspectives, the reality is that not everything is or should be a consensus-based decision. If you’re going to make the final decision, tell people that up front. You can’t get people fired up and excited only to have them find out afterward that you had 51% of the vote. Collaboration becomes messy when there is ambiguity over who is accountable for which decisions, causing decision making to stall.

In addition to decision making, there are a host of other potential ownership rights at stake in a collaborative project. When these go unspoken, collaboration turns sour, feelings get hurt, turf battles ensue, and people become passive-aggressive. Where possible, have the courage to discuss and negotiate:

Who is the relationship owner or point person for stakeholders in this project or account?
How will we recognize and acknowledge the value of each member’s contributions?
How will we share credit or visibility opportunities?
How will we share in any assets, intellectual property, or business value created in the collaboration?
Pull through, prioritize, and inform. Don’t stop at the point of having a great discussion. Ensure that meetings end with people knowing who is going to do what and by when. Furthermore, before moving on to the next thing, remember to loop back with colleagues and let them know what you’ve done with the valuable information, contacts, or resources they’ve provided. A thank you, acknowledgement, or quick status update can go a long way toward minimizing confusion or potential resentments down the road.

Effective collaboration is about leadership. The best collaborators sit at the intersection of high IQ and high EQ. Likewise, as Gratton and Erickson point out in their research, “groups with high levels of collaborative behavior…[have team leaders] who are both task and relationship oriented.”

By considering the situations where more minds are better than one, bringing the right people to the table, staying open to listening, demonstrating courage to negotiate, and making sure work gets prioritized, leaders can get the benefits of collaboration without getting mired in its messiness.






Being a Strategic Leader Is About Asking the Right Questions

If you asked the world’s most successful business leaders what it means to “be strategic,” how many different answers do you think you’d get? Consider this number: 115,800,000. It’s the number of unique links returned when I searched online for “strategic leadership.”

There’s a good reason for all of those links: Strategy is complex. Thought leaders from all over the world have created sophisticated frameworks designed to help leaders grapple with their own strategies at an abstract level. But the reality is that strategy succeeds or fails based on how well leaders at every level of an organization integrate strategic thinking into day-to-day operations. This is less about complexity and more about practical focus.

How can you personally be more strategic as a leader? Consider asking yourself and your team the five questions below to drive clarity, alignment, and strategic insight. The questions build on one another, leading to a well-aligned, strategic perspective. If you make these five questions part of your ongoing dialog, you will inevitably become more strategic and more successful as a team.

1. What are we doing today?
Leaders are often surprised at just how much they don’t know about what team members are working on. Here’s why: Over time, organizations add more and more to the plates of various teams and employees. While leaders and team members talk at length about new initiatives and assignments, they focus less on legacy work that’s still being done. At some point leaders lose sight of just how much time people are investing in legacy priorities. Asking this question almost always brings to light significant work that managers aren’t aware is being done or that’s taking much more time than it should. You can’t move your team forward strategically without knowing the answer to this question with total clarity.

2. Why are you doing the work you’re doing? Why now?
Once you’ve taken stock of all the work being done by your team, the next logical step is to examine the importance of the work being done. This serves two strategic purposes. First, you gain clarity on what’s important and why it’s important from your team’s perspective. You’ll likely uncover situations where you and your team are uncertain or in disagreement. This drives important conversations with your team about choices, resources, and trade-offs. Second, you have the opportunity to attach value and meaning to the work being done by your team. Everyone wants to believe that the work they do matters. It’s your job to understand and articulate that with your own team and across the organization. The only way you get there is with scrutiny.

3. How does what we’re doing today align with the bigger picture?
Never underestimate the power of gaining total clarity about your own area of responsibility and then examining how well your work aligns with the broader goals of the organization. This is a discussion about gaps and outliers. If your team is working on something that doesn’t align with the broader purpose or goals of the organization, you have a responsibility to challenge the value of doing that work. This is true even if your team believes the work is important or meaningful. Does it bring value to your customers? Does it contribute to the highest priorities of the business? Work that benefits both your customers and your business should be the top priority. If you identify gaps not currently being addressed, more strategic discussion is needed. Are you doing exactly, and only, what most benefits your organization?

4. What does success look like for our team?
Chances are that you have a handful of measures that others use to evaluate your success. Do they tell the story of what success really looks like for your team? If you asked your team what success looks like for them individually and for the team overall, could they articulate an answer? The best strategic thinkers invest time here — not in trying to pacify their boss with a few measures that can readily be achieved, but in trying to understand what really drives success in terms of activities, behaviors, relationships, and strategic outcomes. The better you are able to align your team around a strong vision of success, the more likely you are to achieve it.

5. What else could we do to achieve more, better, faster?
Most leaders want to demonstrate their ability to “be strategic” by jumping directly to this question. If you haven’t done the work to answer the preceding questions, it almost doesn’t matter what you come up with here, because you may or may not be able to act on it. But if you do the work to answer the preceding questions, you are well positioned to be strategic in answering this one. You may identify new and better ways to serve the broader goals of your company. You may choose to redirect resources from current work that matters less in relative importance when compared to other new possibilities. This question is the most important of the five; every great leader needs to challenge their team to do more, better, or faster over time. It is, however, inextricably linked to the previous questions if you want to generate the best strategic insights.

The bottom line: Being a strategic leader is about asking the right questions and driving the right dialog with your team. In doing so, you raise the team’s collective ability to be strategic. The more competent you become in asking these questions, the better positioned you are to drive progress for your team and your organization.


Spending 10 Minutes a Day on Mindfulness Subtly Changes the Way You React to Everything

Leaders across the globe feel that the unprecedented busyness of modern-day leadership makes them more reactive and less proactive. There is a solution to this hardwired, reactionary leadership approach: mindfulness.

Having trained thousands of leaders in the techniques of this ancient practice, we’ve seen over and over again that a diligent approach to mindfulness can help people create a one-second mental space between an event or stimulus and their response to it. One second may not sound like a lot, but it can be the difference between making a rushed decision that leads to failure and reaching a thoughtful conclusion that leads to increased performance. It’s the difference between acting out of anger and applying due patience. It’s a one-second lead over your mind, your emotions, your world.

Research has found that mindfulness training alters our brains and how we engage with ourselves, others, and our work. When practiced and applied, mindfulness fundamentally alters the operating system of the mind. Through repeated mindfulness practice, brain activity is redirected from ancient, reactionary parts of the brain, including the limbic system, to the newest, rational part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex.

In this way mindfulness practice decreases activity in the parts of the brain responsible for fight-or-flight and knee-jerk reactions while increasing activity in the part of the brain responsible for what’s termed our executive functioning. This part of the brain, and the executive functioning skills it supports, is the control center for our thoughts, words, and actions. It’s the center of logical thought and impulse control. Simply put, relying more on our executive functioning puts us firmly in the driver’s seat of our minds, and by extension our lives.

One second can be the difference between achieving desired results or not. One second is all it takes to become less reactive and more in tune with the moment. In that one second lies the opportunity to improve the way you decide and direct, the way you engage and lead. That’s an enormous advantage for leaders in fast-paced, high-pressure jobs.

Here are five easily implemented tips to help you become more mindful:

Practice 10 minutes of mindfulness training each day. Most people find mornings the best time to practice mindfulness, but you can do it any time of day. You can find a 10-minute guided mindfulness training program, a short mindfulness training manual, and a link to a free downloadable mindfulness app here. Try it for four weeks.
Avoid reading email first thing in the morning. Our minds are generally most focused, creative, and expansive in the morning. This is the time to do focused, strategic work and have important conversations. If you read your email as you get up, your mind will get sidetracked and you’ll begin the slide toward reactive leadership. Making email your first task of the day wastes the opportunity to use your mind at its highest potential. Try waiting at least 30 minutes, or even an hour, after you get to work before checking your inbox.
Turn off all notifications. The notification alarms on your phone, tablet, and laptop are significant contributors to reactive leadership. They keep you mentally busy and put you under pressure, thereby triggering reactionary responses. They cause damage far more than they add value. Try this: For one week turn off all email notifications on all devices. Only check your email once every hour (or as often as responsibly needed for your job), but don’t compulsively check messages as they roll into your inbox.
Stop multitasking. It keeps your mind full, busy, and under pressure. It makes you reactive. Try to maintain focus on a single task, and then notice when you find your mind drifting off to another task — a sign that your brain wishes to multitask. When this happens, mentally shut down all the superfluous tasks entering your thoughts while maintaining focus on the task at hand.
Put it on your calendar. Schedule a check-in with yourself every two weeks to assess how well you’re doing with the previous four tips, or as a reminder to revisit this article to refresh your memory. Consider engaging one of your peers to do the same thing. This gives you a chance to assess each other, which can be both helpful and motivating.
We encourage you to give these tips a try. Although mindfulness isn’t a magic pill, it will help you more actively select your responses and make calculated choices instead of succumbing to reactionary decisions.

For our upcoming book on mindful leadership, we’re surveying leaders on various aspects of their work experiences. If you’re in a leadership role, and would like to participate, we’d love to hear from you.













What a Study of 33 Countries Found About Aging Populations and Innovation
The populations of almost all Western countries are getting older, as the Baby Boomers, born in the 1950s and 1960s, live longer and have fewer children than previous generations. Population aging of this dimension is possibly unique in world history. No surprise, then, that it poses serious challenges for the health care systems, pension schemes, and public debt management of modern societies.

More often than not, politicians see economic growth as a means to alleviate these problems. The arguments are simple: Faster growth means more income to be spent on medical treatments for the old. Higher wages increase the contributions to pay-as-you-go pension schemes, thus preventing pensions from falling. And growth reduces the government’s debt-to-GDP ratio, which facilitates and cheapens future government borrowing.

The problem is that population aging is itself a cause for a decline in both GDP and per-capita GDP. Due to a sustained decline in fertility, there are fewer young people entering the labor force than there are old workers leaving it. The active labor force declines over time, and so does GDP. In addition, as longevity increases, a reduced labor force has to nourish more and more retirees and for longer. Accordingly, GDP per capita tends to fall.

Innovation could come to the rescue by boosting the productivity of the remaining labor force. If the more productive few can produce as much output as the less productive many, GDP will not fall. Similarly, with fewer but more productive workers in the population, per-capita GDP may stay constant. Innovation is the means; economic growth is the end.

Can we plausibly expect aging societies to be as innovative as they need to be? Sociologists, policy makers, and cultural researchers tend to stress the hypothesis that old societies lose the spirit of enterprise, favor security over risky dynamism, and become less forward-looking. If this is true, there is little hope. Population aging will lead societies into a state of stagnation with little inventive activity.

We studied a panel of 33 OECD countries in the period 1960–2012 to find out the actual relationship between population aging and inventive activity across countries and time. We measured population aging by the old-age dependency ratio — people older than 64 to the working population ages 15–64 — and inventive activity by the number of patents per 1,000 residents.

The relationship between population aging and inventive activity turned out to be hump-shaped, with a peak occurring at a dependency ratio between 24 and 27 older people per 100 members of the working-age population. This is surprisingly old — such levels were reached in Japan from 1999–2003 and in Germany from 2001–2004. Countries located to the left of the hump may age and see their inventive activity increase; those to the right will inevitably see it fall as they age even further.

What explains such a pattern?

Other studies provide some evidence that the decrease in inventive activity after a certain old-age dependency ratio can be explained by individuals’ tendency to grow less creative with age.

Our hypothesis is that on the left side of the hump necessity is the mother of invention. To solve their age-induced problems, societies invest in innovation. Aging populations understand at some level that their standard of living hinges on a rising labor productivity of the working young, and they know that innovations are the main drivers of productivity growth.

In another study, we looked at individual attitudes toward innovation in a cross-section of 18 OECD countries for which individual-level data is available. We found that the older people are, the less they appreciate innovation. However, in societies where the whole population is aging, this tendency is weaker. This suggests that the process of population aging may lead to a better understanding and a willingness to adapt one’s attitude toward innovative activity.

What can policy makers and entrepreneurs learn from these studies? An aging society needs a strategy to foster inventive activity to secure its standard of living.


Germany and Japan are two aging countries grappling with this problem in systemic ways. Germany’s national innovation strategy, the so-called High-Tech Strategy 2020, funds research and innovation at the national and state level, supporting investments in growth areas such as green innovation, a major German strength. Japan adopted its Comprehensive Strategy on Science, Technology, and Innovation in 2013. The focus of this strategy is the environment, energy, health and medical care, and social challenges. Opening to other Asian economies was also part of the strategy.

We recommend that policy makers work to raise awareness about the adverse effects of population aging, communicating to their citizens what aging means for their individual health care, the level of their pensions, and the economic functioning of their government. Awareness acts as a catalyst, changing attitudes and bringing about a societal climate more favorable to investment in innovation.

In sum, in countries that understand the consequences of their aging population, entrepreneurs are more likely to find profitable business opportunities. This will benefit the old as well as the young.









Ambassador To China Shares Lessons Learned With The Next Administration
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

President Obama's ambassadors - the political appointees, not career diplomats - they have until next Friday, Inauguration Day, to clear out of their embassies. This is one of the many ways President-elect Donald Trump is trying to mark a break with the outgoing administration. Among those coming home next week is Max Baucus, the U.S. ambassador to China since 2014, and before that, a longtime senator representing the state of Montana. Trump is nominating Iowa Governor Terry Branstad to succeed Baucus.

Ambassador Baucus joins us now on the line from Beijing. Thank you so much for being with us.

MAX BAUCUS: You bet, Rachel. Good hearing you.

MARTIN: In your dealings with Chinese officials since the election, how do they view Donald Trump's victory?

BAUCUS: They're a little uncertain. They find him unpredictable. Of course, many people find him unpredictable. They're kind of laying low, assessing what seems to make the most sense for China. My advice to them is to try to find ways to look for opportunities where they, the Chinese, can take some initiatives to show to the new administration that they very much want to work with and are - want to partner with the United States.

MARTIN: You've said the U.S. needs to stand up for itself in its relationship with China. And since his election, Trump has rattled China by speaking with the president of Taiwan and talking about raising tariffs on Chinese imports. Is that the kind of thing you had in mind when you said stand up in its relationship?

BAUCUS: No, no. I think basically that, although we have a quite good relationship with China, that the time has come for the United States to be a little bit more firm in some areas, especially economic. I think that the level playing field is so unlevel - it is tilted so much in favor of Chinese companies - that it's time for the United States to do a little bit more, see.

You know, you've got to stop denying our investors' investment in China, stop denying access to our companies trying to enter Chinese markets. And then if they don't, then we're going to have to look for appropriate, solid ways to show to China that, I'm sorry, we just have to do something because we can't keep going on like this.

MARTIN: When you say do something, what does that mean?

BAUCUS: It means finding some reciprocal action. But first, if they don't stop, that we have no choice but to take a specified, or if not specified, make it clear it's going to be a very large reciprocal actions that gets their attention. We've done this in the past and it works.

MARTIN: I want to ask you about some comments that Rex Tillerson made earlier this week during his confirmation hearing. He's, of course, Trump's pick to become the next secretary of state. He was talking about the South China Sea. Let's listen to that clip.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

REX TILLERSON: We are going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island building stops and second, your access to those islands is also not going to be allowed.

MARTIN: Our correspondent in Shanghai, Rob Schmitz, is reporting this morning that those comments aren't going over so well in the Chinese press, that media there is filled with threats of retaliation, even talk of war with the U.S. How are you reacting to those comments?

BAUCUS: My basic advice to the Chinese, with respect to the South China Sea is, hey, guys, cool it. We have said that to the Chinese in the past, and it has worked. They have stopped. I don't know that it's wise to publicly and loudly and with a large megaphone make some of those statements. I think it's much wiser privately, as we have done, to say to the Chinese, no more. And 'cause if there is any more, there will be definite consequences.

MARTIN: You've been a staunch supporter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal, the TPP. It appears Trump is walking away from that. That was part and parcel of the Obama administration's big pivot to Asia. What happens with that policy now?

BAUCUS: Failure to pass TPP sends a big signal. The United States is backing off, backing away. That will create a huge void here. Politics abhors a vacuum. China will start to fill that vacuum by putting together its own trade deals, its own agreements, putting pressure on other countries in the region, and it's just going to be a problem for all of us.

And I very much hope that the Trump administration reconsiders and finds a way - it doesnt have to be exactly the same TPP - but finds a way to get - go back to the table, show up to the Chinese, hey, if you want to join, we'll try to find a way where you can join, too. It's critical. Since I've been here as ambassador, nothing has passed my desk which is more critical than this, nothing comes close, for our strategic long-term interests.

MARTIN: U.S. Ambassador to China Max Baucus, thank you so much.

BAUCUS: You bet.









The week that Obama and Biden cried

(CNN)It's been a rough week for America, but it's been a good week for masculinity. No, not because we had to endure another display of Donald Trump's bellicose machismo, but because we witnessed two of the most powerful men in the world allow themselves to shed tears in public.

Speaking of his love and appreciation for first lady Michelle Obama, President Obama was moved to tears. And, surprised by the president's decision to award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Vice President Joe Biden cried, too. Might it be that we are finally, blessedly, moving beyond a world in which "big boys don't cry"?

To be sure, there are resisters and naysayers. To take one example, media personality Laura Ingraham insisted that Obama's crying was an act. After all, she said, "I've never seen a man grab a tissue and dab, I've just never seen that ... A man will be like 'whatever' or, like, fake through it or something."
In other words, even though he might be moved to cry, a real man would never show it. Eight years ago, Ingraham mocked NFL star Brett Favre for being a "big hulky man" who "broke down blubbering" at this retirement press conference." "Enough with the waterworks," she demanded.
Can a real man not cry? And if he does, must he hide it?


I say: Let the tears flow.
What makes someone a "real man"? Who do we want our sons to be? And who do we want fathers and husbands to be?
Is the only "real man" an alpha male, one who denies his own vulnerability -- sometimes denying it so forcefully that he mocks or denigrates (or maybe just sneers at) those he sees as less than perfect, as too vulnerable, as insufficiently tough and guarded? Might it be that in this day and age a major part of what it ought to mean to be a man is an ability to admit that we are vulnerable, to be as tender as we are tough, to live with our hearts open and to refuse to be ashamed about it?


I am grateful to live at a time when a man -- the most powerful man in the world, no less -- can model what it means to let life affect him to the point where tears come. Would you want to be married to a man who has never been moved to tears by his love and appreciation of another human being?
But I am not kidding myself. We have a long way to go in transforming masculinity. There are still far too many men -- and, if we take Ingraham's comments as evidence, women too-- who insist that real men don't cry, that a man with a tissue is really just a "sissy." (That kind of regressive masculinity, it seems, will now enter the Oval Office.)
Make no mistake: That kind of thinking and talking has real consequences for men and boys. My father died suddenly when I was 12 years old, and I remember -- it is etched into my mind and my body -- being firmly instructed by a well-intentioned relative, "You can't cry. You have to hold it together."
I recall being told by countless visitors that "I had to be strong for my mother." And so I walked around for years pretending to be OK, tough, strong, even though I had just lost everything. That kind of repression takes a toll on a man's emotional and physical health.



Can a man not be strong and cry -- without shame? Perhaps we can model the courage it takes to cry when our heart hurts and the world seems to have fallen apart. Perhaps we can model the presence and openheartedness that make it possible to cry because the love another person has for us nourishes and sustains us.
I hope my sons will one day find a love so deep that it moves them to tears, and I hope that they remain unaffected by those who would deprive them of the full range of human emotion. When all is said and done, those who mock men who cry do little but betray their own emotional impoverishment.
